This is a website layout for a an educational counseling business for highschool students looking to study in the UK. The business belongs to some friends of mine, 
and I figured it would be a good opportunity to do some practicing.  

Features:
- uses Bootstrap 
- uses CSS animations for the hover state of the feature icons

Features I want to implement:
- an interactive map that shows where Oxford Nation's previous clients are studying now in the UK. 

All sugestions are, of course, welcome :D.
